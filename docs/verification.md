# Verification

Run the complete regression set from the project root, passing the console Godot executable:

```powershell
./scripts/run_tests.ps1 -GodotPath 'C:\path\to\Godot_console.exe'
```

The runner discovers tests/*_test.tscn, uses the normal project/autoload startup at a 60 FPS cap, and bounds each run with --quit-after 1800. A zero exit code alone is insufficient: each scene must print PASS, with no SCRIPT ERROR, ERROR, or WARNING lines. A failed scene makes the command fail. Logs are written under .godot/validation. APPDATA/LOCALAPPDATA overrides are restored afterward.

The current 17 scenes cover:

| Area | Coverage |
| --- | --- |
| States/lifecycle | Ownership, presentation hooks, callback gates, shutdown once, replacement, nested entities, input disconnection |
| Movement | Walk/run, shared modifiers, reversal, slide retention, air rates and context |
| Jump/collision | Variable height, weight, ceilings/audio, gap clearance, ledges, bounded corner correction, running-gap recovery |
| Animation | Walk cadence, static poses, passive-fall freezing/resume, question-block phases, one-shot Bonk activation, used appearance and fixed-collider bounce |
| Input | Keyboard and raw controller primary events, gating |
| Camera | Edge clamping, scroll thresholds, constant fractional steps, one-way limits, live traversal |
| Layout grid | Inherited ground layer, reset transforms and cell size/shape, preserved painted cells, matching cell origins and entity placement |
| Bonk contacts | Partial underside hits at both edges, correct target left/at/right of a seam, no redirection from a used block, no activation on side-only contacts or escaped corners |
| Level entities | Marker generation, no duplicate spawning, non-solid entities, solid blocks, repeatable brick bounces, hit rejection during bounce, coordinates, shutdown |

The wider camera and block tests construct their own fixtures; changing the painted test stage should not redefine those expectations.

For scene cleanup, also check scene/resource paths and declared-resource usage, instantiate the generic bases and concrete scenes, and inspect a rendered preview. Empty state machines are deliberately supported. Mario-only Presentation belongs to Mario; BasePlayer supplies its referenced AnimationPlayer and shared physics/actions.

Headless tests do not prove subjective movement feel, display frame pacing, speaker output, or renderer performance. A Forward+ render smoke check can catch scene/material failures and layering regressions, but interactive editor playtesting remains useful. No exact NES trace qualification is claimed.
